1. **What type of cybersecurity threat is perhaps most uniquely, given the nature of it, a risk in a research project like SETI@Home, and how might that threat materialize?**
---
In a research project like SETI@Home, one uniquely cybersecurity threat could be the injection of malware into the distributed computing network.

2. **What are zero-day attacks and why are they a threat?**
----
This kind of attacks exploit the vulnerabilities that are recently discovered in software and the software company has yet to patch it or the user forget to update the software. New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. A adversary with up to date knowledge might easily hack your computer if you forget to update your software or developers are unable to find the vulnerabilities and patch it on time.

3. **What is port scanning and how is it a threat?**
---
Port scanning is a process where different technique is used to probe a server to find open ports. It's a threat because adversaries can use it to find weak points of any open port and use it to can unauthorized access to system.

4. What are supercookies? Via what means do we most commonly obtain/receive them, and how do they create threats to our systems?
---
Super cookies are tracking cookies used by website to monitor users online activities. They are obtained by visiting any website that employs this technologies. They are threat to user privacy as websites use it to do targeted advertisement or adversaries use it to add malware, virus etc to computer of the user.

5. **What makes a _worm_ distinct from a _virus_?**
---
Main distinction in their ability to propagate to the network. A virus does not propagate on their own but a worm on the other hand scans the nearby network and moves from one network to another without any user interaction.

6. **Provide a technological example of “security through obscurity”?**
---
SSH uses port 22 to access a system, but changing the ssh port to another port and closing ssh port 22 is a example of security through obscurity. Because rather than protecting it with ssh keys, changing ports is like trying to hide the door by moving it to another side.

7.   **Distinguish the concepts of SSH and VPN.**
----
SSH is the way to secure a single connection usually to connect to remote devices and execute commands. VPN encrypts all incoming and outgoing connections to a computer whether it is simple browsing, remote login everything.

8. **What purpose does the X.509 standard serve?**
---
X.509 as standard format for digital certificate serves as benchmark to make sure the secure connections are legit. It verifies website, user's identity etc on internet enhancing security and trust.

9. **Why might a company want to perform pen testing?** 
---
Pen testing a way to simulate cybersecurity attack on servers. Companies might want to test their server using pen testing to find any vulnerabilities that exits which adversaries can hack into and patch them up.
